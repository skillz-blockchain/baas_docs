## Creation

In order to create a consortium, you need to head on the page 'Consortiums'.
On the top right hand corner you will see a _Create a consortium_ button that will allow you to create one.
Read carefully the warning shown

Once you created it, you can rename it as ou wish by clicking on its name.

## Inviting people

You can invite someone to your consortium by searching its mail into the left search bar.

Once invited, the person has full access to the consortium, and can invite people too.
He will have the possibility to add a node to this consortium and then read/write onto the blockchain.

## Adding a _node_

If you're part of a consortium and have a _Running_ ([how to launch a node ?](Node.md#launching-your-node)) node, you can link it to a consortium.
You can add it either by:

- Going onto the consortium page and search your node on the right search bar and typing the name of your node.
- Clicking on _Add to a consortium_ on the node page on the top right hand corner.
- Clicking on _Associate_ on the Nodes list page on the node you want to associate to a consortium.

## Removing a node

You can remove a _node_ from a consortium. You will lose access to the blockchain and then the blockchain explorer.

To remove a node from a consortium, you have to remove the entire node. To do so, you can click on the trash bin icon wherever you see your node.

## Removing a consortium

For the moment, you can't remove any consortium, even if you created it.
We are thinking about a solution where everyone has to agree to remove the consortium but it's not out yet.
