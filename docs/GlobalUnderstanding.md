BaaS aims at creating a consortium between people who will share a blockchain.
It helps people setting up a blockchain in a few clicks and connect them through a SaaS platform.
Once a consortium and a blockchain is created, the blockchain acts like a normal blockchain connected with the people of your consortium.

## Consortium

A consortium is a group of people. They can invite other people in this consortium by searching their email.
Being in a consortium allows you to add a _Node_ to it.
Adding a node to a consortium will enable you to interact with the blockchain and access a _Blockchain Explorer_.

Everybody in the consortium can invite new people to join the group.

## Node

The _Node_ is the entity that will run on your machine in order to connect to a consortium.
It hosts a blockchain node and a service that allows you to control your node directly from the platform.
The blockchain node is not started until you join a consortium.
When you join a consortium, it will connect to already participating people and launch its own node so you can interact with the blockchain.

The _Node_ is running in a Docker container, so you will need this dependency on your machine in order to be able to run it.
