## Introduction

The blockchain explorer will allow you to inspect the transactions on a consortium. Statistics about the whole blockchain and blocks will be displayed.

## How it works

First of all, you need to have an active node in the consortium in order to be able to access the blockchain reader. The blockchain explorer will fetch data directly from your node and display it through a web page.

Once the node is connected to a consortium and has synchronized, you are allowed to access the Blockchain explorer page from your consortium page. A little button at the bottom of the page will guide you to it.
